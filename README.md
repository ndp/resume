> When people ask for my resume, I send them a PDF of my linked in profile. How pathetic is that?

Why not make a one page resume with the "highlights"? That's what this is. I had the idea to make an organic shaped timeline, and attach my experiences to it. But that will be quite challenging from a visual design perspective, to fit everything on the page and make it understandable. So this is a significantly simplified version of that idea, with the shape remaining, but little else.

I'm using the fonts: Lora + Nunito. Lora is the standard for my web sites, but it is quite heavy in the italic version, so I pulled in Nunito as a secondary font.
