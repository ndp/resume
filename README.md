> When people ask for my resume, I send them a PDF of my linked in profile. How pathetic is that?

Why not make a one page resume with the "highlights"? That's what this is. I had the idea to make an organic shaped timeline, and attach my experiences to it. But that will be quite challenging from a visual design perspective, to fit everything on the page and make it understandable. So this is a significantly simplified version of that idea, with the shape remaining, but little else.

## External references

I generated the curve at https://app.haikei.app/

I'm using the fonts: Lora + Nunito. Lora is the standard for my web sites, but it is quite heavy in the italic version, so I pulled in Nunito as a secondary font. Suggestion comes from https://www.figma.com/google-fonts/lora-font-pairings/#:~:text=Lora%20is%20a%20well%20balanced,%2C%20Ubuntu%2C%20Alegreya%20and%20Nunito.



## Color Schemes

I added the color schemes to be directly configurable. Interesting ones:
