My resume evolved from a typed page to a computerized word document to an XML document with varied XSLT transforms, to the most recent version: a PDF dump of my LinkedIn page. LinkedIn is great and all, but their turning for resume output is anemic. 

I was thinking that flooding people with "everything" might be okay for some subset of the audience (maybe the AI screens?), it didn't really pass the test of quality output.

Despite my occassional scorn for a bit of the "recruiting" process, it makes sense to put together a "good" resume that provides a high-level summary of what I was including with LinkedIn. This repo represents the output of that.

## Context

The goal was to keep the project as low-tech as possible. I would create a clean HTML document, style it with CSS, and be done. One of my original ideas with an organic-shaped timeline,
where my experiences were connected to a meandering path to 
represent the journey. The more I developed the idea, the more I realized that it woudl be a challenging visual design project-- one I was not really equiped to execute gracefully, not matter how much I wanted. So I reduced the scope of the idea, and this is a significantly simplified version of that idea, with only the shape remaining.

I was trying lots of color schemes out, and so I decided to make a little interactive tool to let me do this, so there is a little itsy-bitsy bit of Javascript. Don't call me a scope creep.

Stuff that is not essential, but I stick here for reference.

### External references

I generated the curve at https://app.haikei.app/

I'm using the fonts: Lora + Nunito. Lora is the standard for my web sites, but it is quite heavy in the italic version, so I pulled in Nunito as a secondary font. Suggestion comes from https://www.figma.com/google-fonts/lora-font-pairings/#:~:text=Lora%20is%20a%20well%20balanced,%2C%20Ubuntu%2C%20Alegreya%20and%20Nunito.

### Color Schemes

I added the color schemes to be directly configurable. Interesting ones:
